                <p class = "lc_page"> LC for Robots is a subset of the Library of Congress Labs (LC Labs) that provides access to APIs, bulk data downloads, and other related computational access points for Library of Congress collection data. Their goal is to provide machine- readable access to its digital collections in order to make their data more widely accessible to the general public. Our team completed an eight-month collaborative project to assess our clients’ needs, understand our target users, develop a UX recommendation to meet those needs, and evaluate the impact of our designs. This final report covers the processes our team has accomplished to provide an improved user experience.
