                                <h2>LC for Robots</h2>
                                <p> LC Labs is a data download library. They wanted to expand their user base and make their resources accessible to not just expert, but novice data users. Our team took on this project with the goal of delivering a design recommendation and prototype that would meet the UX requirements of the client and best serve user needs. The challenge was, how can we make this website accessible to all types of users and what problems are users currently facing? </p>

                                <p> To truly understand user needs and pain points we conducted interviews, usability tests, and card sorting sessions. 
                                    Improved information architecture was the first solution we explored to increase accessibility for users. A/B testing was conducted after each prototype iteration of our wireframes and showed a strong increase in both accessibility and user engagement.  </p>
